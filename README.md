# LaunchkeyMiniMG 


This is a simple control script to add additional functionality to the Launchkey Mini. When it's enabled your Launchkey Mini will behave normally, however the knobs and scene launch buttons will be automatically mapped when INCONTROL is disabled as follows : 

• Scene Launch 1: Midi OVERDUB in session view 
• Scene Launch 2: Stop button 

The knobs will control the first 8 tracks of Live and change functionality based on the channel: 

• Channel 1: Volume
• Channel 2: Pan
• Channel 3-8: Sends A-F 

Channel's 9-16 are left to be mapped by the user. Additionally, since this is a control script level control, any of the changes caused by this script are remappable and overrided by Live's Midi map mode. 

To install the script simply clone it into Live's MIDI Remote Scripts folder found here: 

Windows: \ProgramData\Ableton\Live x.x\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\
This folder is hidden by default.
Mac: The Remote Script folder is inside the Ableton Live application bundle. Locate the Live application in Finder, right click on it and select "Show Package Content". Then navigate to: /Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/
